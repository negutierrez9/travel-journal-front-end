            `One of my most memorable experiences while I was studying abroad in Korea was visiting the Gyeongbokgung Palace.
            The palace has free entry if you are wearing a traditional hanbok. I enjoyed picking out my hanbok and getting my hair done.
            There are lot of photo opportunities around the palace, as well as beautiful architecture and gardens.`

            `While in Kyoto, I had the privilege of going to the very popular Fushimi Inari Shrine. I enjoyed walking through the large temple grounds,
            buying an omikuji, and eating a refreshing snack at the rest stop. My favorite part of visiting the shrine was seeing the temple cats eating biscuits
            off the shrines.`

            `I go to Hawaii every year because my family lives there. One of my favorite spots to visit while I'm there is Kailua beach, specifically
            Kalama beach. It is relatively tucked away from the main beach, but it can still be hard to find parking depending when you go. I love this beach
            because it has great waves for boogie boarding. It's also not too windy so you can set up a picnic and eat bento on the beach. I try to go at least twice
            whenever I'm in Hawaii.`
